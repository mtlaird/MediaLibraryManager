Media Library Manager
====

This program is intended to be used to help manage a user's media library. This includes 
 storing metadata for files in the library as well as providing the ability to set and 
 query user-created tags. It can be used to manage files in two primary ways:

* Leaving the files in their existing locations on disk
* Copying the files to a central location

Specific directories can use either management method in a single installation.

Image Gallery

A specific use case for this application is to browse images. The Manager will generate 
thumbnails to make it easier to look over groups of images at the same time.
